## Hydrogenic Computation

```@example hydrogenic
using JAC
```
Perhaps, the simplest atomic computations can be made for hydrogenic ions. If we consider, for example, hydrogen-like argon $(Z=18)$, we can first determine and compare the energies of the $1s$ and $2p$ levels from the (non-relativistic) Schroedinger equation with those from Dirac's relativistic equation by

```@example hydrogenic
Z     = 18.0
e1s   = HydrogenicIon.energy(Shell("1s"), Z)   
```

```@example hydrogenic
e2p   = HydrogenicIon.energy(Shell("2p"), Z)
e2p_1 = HydrogenicIon.energy(Subshell("2p_1/2"), Z)   
e2p_3 = HydrogenicIon.energy(Subshell("2p_3/2"), Z)
```

While the (one-electron) energies are displayed by the function  `HydrogenicIon.energy()` in the default units (presently eV here and as could be overwritten by the user), all **computations are internally performed and returned always in atomic units**. This applies to all computations if not stated otherwise in the description of some particular function; indeed, the user-defined units mainly in the tabulation of results but are not *returned*. Most of these tabulations are generated by *display* method which print some table to screen but return `nothing` otherwise.

This clear distinction between the use of **atomic** and **(user-specified) default** units can be seen  easily from the output of the variables `e2p`, `e2p_1`, `e2p_3` above: 

```@example hydrogenic
(e2p, e2p_1, e2p_3) 
```

The units of energies, rates and several other physical properties can be however quite easily converted among each other, for instance, by:

```@example hydrogenic
e1s_eV = convertUnits("energy: from atomic to eV", e1s)
e1s_au = convertUnits("energy: from eV to atomic", e1s_eV)
(e1s, e1s_eV, e1s_au)
```

... and similarly also for other energy units as well as for other physical entities; cf. `? convertUnits()`.

From these energies, we can easily compute the fine-structure splitting of the $2p$ level into the $2p_{1/2}$ and $2p_{3/2}$ (fine-structure) levels for hydrogen-like argon from above:

```@example hydrogenic
e13 = e2p_1 - e2p_3
e13_eV = convertUnits("energy: from atomic to eV", e13)
```

Apart from the (single-electron) energies, we can generate also the radial orbitals, i.e. the $P(r)$ in the non-relativistic theory or  $P(r)$ and $Q(r)$  in the relativistic theory. Both, the relativistic and non-relativistic orbitals, can be calculated by using the general (and analytically well-known) solutions of either the Dirac's or SchrÃ¶dinger's equation. 

However, since all (radial) orbital functions are represented on some `Radial.Grid`, special care has to be taken in order to define a proper grid, and which affects also all subsequent numerical computations as well as the accuracy that can be obtained. To better understand the definition of the grid, let us ask for:

```
? Radial.Grid
```

```@docs ; canonical = false
Radial.Grid
```

which shows the internal definition and the constructors to define such a grid. In practice, there are three (logical) levels that are considered and realized for each grid: 
(i) The **phenomenological grid** definition that is based on our physics understanding and intuition of which grid is appropriate to decribe a particular atomic property or process. Two currently implemented grid refers to an *exponential* grid (with exponentially increasing stepsize) as appropriate for many bound-state computations and a *linear-logarithmic* grid that start exponentially but becomes linear in its stepsize for large values of $r$. Such a *linear-logarithmic* grid is typically needed to describe electron ionization and capture processes as the incoming or outgoing electron waves are *sinusoidal* and should be represented with a proper number of grid points, say 20-30, per period of the electron wave. In JAC, the *phenomenologically* part of the grid is chosen (analogue as in GRASP) by the parameters `rnt`, `h`, `hp` and `NoPoints` in the definition above. 

(ii) The *phenomenological* definition of the grid is internally translated into a **sequence of knots** upon which the B-spline primitives are defined. Here, each `nth` mesh point from the phenomenological is chosen to keep the number of B-splines and the corresponding size of matrices (that need to be diagonalized) moderate. These knots are used to define the B-splines and to determine the eigenvectors of all orbitals (within some given potential) but they are not applied in order evaluate matrix elements or radial integrals.

(iii) The *phenomenological* grid and the definition of the B-splines (knots) are eventually combined into a **physical grid** upon which all radial functions are represented. This physical grid resembles the phenomenological grid but with modified grid points in between the *knots* of the B-spline grid
(t-grid). Here the radial points and corresponding weights are chosen due to a Gauss-Legendre distribution and goal to determine all radial integrals *exact* up to a given *Gauss-Legendre order*.

The **physical grid** is thus defined by the three arrays `r` (the mesh points along $r$), `rp` (the derivatives d `r`/ dr), `rpor` (the values rp / r) as well as `w` (the corresponding weights). All these arrays are of length `nr` $\approx$ `NoPoints` but not necessarely equal as the grid points `nr` are coupled to the underlying integration, respectively, interpolation scheme. 

In principle, this physical grid could chosen also on other *interpolation/integration* formulas, such as Gauss-Laguerre or others, that have been utilized in atomic physics. All what is needed would be to adapt the intermediate grid point and weights accordingly.

The clear distinction between the **phenomenological grid** and the **physical grid** help avoid that every new (radial) operator as well as particular boundary condition of the radial orbital functions need to be treated independently within the B-spline basis. Instead, a proper *interpolation/integration* formula should guarantee that all results are integrated sufficiently accurate, and this is first of all tested by enlarging the number of grid point `NoPoint` --> `nr`

Here, we first apply an *exponential grid*, and which is appropriate below in order to compute various expectation values:

```@example hydrogenic
grid   = Radial.Grid(true, printout= true)
```

With this grid, the non-relativistic radial orbitals $P(r)$ can be obtained either for a single $r$-value, for a list of $r$-values as well as for all $r$-values on a given radial grid:

```@example hydrogenic
Pnr_1s = HydrogenicIon.radialOrbital(Shell("1s"), Z, grid)
Pnr_2p = HydrogenicIon.radialOrbital(Shell("2p"), Z, grid)
```

Here, the exponential tails of the radial orbitals are simply set to zero if $|P| < 1.0e-15$ (and similarly for $|Q|$).

Of course, we could plot the two functions `Pnr_1s` and `Pnr_2p` directly by some proper call of `PyPlot`, and if we give the correct arrays of radial mesh points from above.

```@example hydrogenic
using Plots 
plot(grid.r, [Pnr_1s, Pnr_2p],xlims=(0,1), xlabel = "r (a.u.)", ylabel="Amplitude (a.u.)", label=["1s" "2p"])
savefig("hdy-1.svg"); nothing # hide
```

![](hdy-1.svg)

We can also make use of this function to visualise the relativistic orbitals if we specify the total angular momentum and generate the relativistic orbitals, which contain both the large and the small component.

```@example hydrogenic
setDefaults("standard grid", grid)
PQr_1s = HydrogenicIon.radialOrbital(Subshell("1s_1/2"), Z, grid)
PQr_2p1 = HydrogenicIon.radialOrbital(Subshell("2p_1/2"), Z, grid)
PQr_2p3 = HydrogenicIon.radialOrbital(Subshell("2p_3/2"), Z, grid)
plot(grid.r, [PQr_1s,PQr_2p1, PQr_2p3],xlims=(0,1), xlabel = "r (a.u.)", ylabel="Amplitude (a.u.)", label=["1s - Large component" "1s - Small component" "2p_1/2 - Large component" "2p_1/2 - Small component" "2p_3/2 - Large component" "2p_3/2 - Small component"])
savefig("hdy-2.svg"); nothing # hide
```

![](hdy-2.svg)


In practice, using Pyplot is often quite tedious since all the specification of arrays, axes, labels, etc. need to be given explicitly. To display the shape of such orbitals, a special plotting method is prepared in JAC that displayes one or several orbitals together. 

```
? Basics.plot
```

```@docs ; canonical = false
Basics.plot
```

This `Basics.plot` function (from the Basics module) accepts for instance a list of (relativistic) radial `Orbitals`:

```
? Orbital
```

```@docs ; canonical = false
Orbital
```

Of course, the main purpose of this `plot` method is to display and compare a number of generated orbitals, either for getting physical insight or just for test purposes. We can make use of the same `plot` method also for the non-relativistic  `Pnr_1s`$(r)$  orbital if we assign this array as large component of a relativistic orbital and specify the additional quantum numbers. Moreover, we here first internally to define a standard grid as well as such an (instance of the) Orbital by using its standard constructor, and by setting the small  $Q(r)$ component as well as $dP/dr$ and $dQ/dr$ simply to zero:

```@example hydrogenic
setDefaults("standard grid", grid)
Qnr_1s   = Pprime = Qprime = zeros( length(Pnr_1s) )
nrOrb_1s = Orbital( Subshell("1s_1/2"), true, true, e1s, Pnr_1s, Qnr_1s, Pprime, Qprime, Radial.Grid())
typeof(nrOrb_1s)
```

We could also compute a relativistic $1s_{1/2}$ orbital on the given grid and plot the two $1s$-orbitals together; while the large components of these orbitals coincide of course, due to its special construction via the non-relativistic orbitals, the small compoments differ. Note that one need to use the standard REPL in order to display these functions in some separate window.

```@example hydrogenic
Orb_1s = HydrogenicIon.radialOrbital(Subshell("1s_1/2"), Z, grid)
e1s_1 = HydrogenicIon.energy(Subshell("1s_1/2"), Z)
rOrb_1s = Orbital( Subshell("1s_1/2"), true, true, e1s_1, Orb_1s[1], Orb_1s[2], Pprime, Qprime, Radial.Grid())
```

```@example hydrogenic
plot("radial orbitals: both", Orbital[nrOrb_1s, rOrb_1s], grid; N = 230)
savefig("hdy-3.svg"); nothing # hide
```

![](hdy-3.svg)

We can use these orbitals to quickly evaluate some overlap integrals and $\langle r^k \rangle$ expectation values; for this, we make use of the non-relativistic $2p$ radial orbital `Pnr_2p` from above and compute the normalization  and $\langle r \rangle$ expectation values:

```@example hydrogenic
N_1s = RadialIntegrals.overlap(Pnr_1s, Pnr_1s, grid)
N_2p = RadialIntegrals.overlap(Pnr_2p, Pnr_2p, grid)
r_exp_1s = RadialIntegrals.rkDiagonal(1, Pnr_1s, Pnr_1s,grid)
r_exp_2p = RadialIntegrals.rkDiagonal(1, Pnr_2p, Pnr_2p,grid)
println("N_1s = $(N_1s)","\n","N_2p = $(N_2p)","\n","r_exp_1s = $(r_exp_1s)","\n","r_exp_2p = $(r_exp_2p)")
```

As we can see the radial orbitals are already normalized by construction and the expectation values match with the analytic values of $\langle r \rangle_{nl} = \frac{1}{2Z}[3nÂ²-l(l+1)]$. 

For the sake of simplicity, all hydrogenic computations are performed for a point-like nucleus. For many-electron computations, in constrast, a more realistic nucleus can be taken into accout by selecting a proper nuclear model. See the tutorial: Define the nuclear model parameters   or   `? Nuclear.Model`  ... for further details.

```
 ? Nuclear.Model
```

```@docs
Nuclear.Model
```

If we would like to compute a relativistic orbital by taking into account the type of the nucleus, we can simply define a nuclear model: 

```@example hydrogenic
Nucleus = Model(Z, "Fermi")
```

and set it as an argument value of the radialOrbital-function. By comparing the analytic orbitals which are based on a point like nucleus and the orbitals taking into account a fermi distributed nucleus one can see, that the influence of the nucleus is negligible for large r. However by looking at the functions at a closer angle the influence of the nucleus is well visible for small r. 

```@example hydrogenic
nuc_orb_1s = HydrogenicIon.radialOrbital(Subshell("1s_1/2"),Nucleus, grid)
plot("radial orbitals: both", [nuc_orb_1s,rOrb_1s], grid; N = 230)
savefig("hdy-4.svg"); nothing # hide
```

![](hdy-4.svg)

```@example hydrogenic
plot("radial orbitals: both", [nuc_orb_1s,rOrb_1s], grid; N = 75)
savefig("hdy-2.svg"); nothing # hide
```


## Compute the low-lying levels of $C^{2+} 1s^2 (2s^2 + 2s2p + 2p^2)$: $\;$ SCF and configuration interaction calculations

```@example scfci
using JAC
```

The low-lying levels (level structure) of beryllium-like ions, and especially of C``^{2+}``, has been calculated in many case studies
in the literature. While the level structure of these ions is still quite simple, it exhibits a considerable admixture of the 
``2s^22p^2`` configuration already for the ``1s^{2}2s^{2}`` ``^{1}S_{0}`` ground level.

We here show how the low-lying levels of C``^{2+}`` can be readily calculated in JAC by either following the default settings or
by specifying further details for both, the SCF and configuration-interaction (CI) computations. As usual, we first need to 
specify a radial grid as well as the nuclear model for the subsequent computations:

```@example scfci
grid     = Radial.Grid(true)
nucModel = Nuclear.Model(6., "Fermi")
```

For a *quick* computation of the ground level of C$^{2+}$ ions, we can simply use the **standard settings** as given by `AsfSettings()`:

```@example scfci
multiplet     = SelfConsistent.performSCF([Configuration("1s^2 2s^2")], nucModel, grid, AsfSettings());
Basics.tabulate(stdout, "multiplet: energies", multiplet, Array(1:length(multiplet.levels)) )       # hide
Basics.tabulate(stdout, "multiplet: energy of each level relative to lowest level", multiplet, Array(1:length(multiplet.levels)) )  # hide
```

... and, similarly, also for the 10 lowest levels of C$^{2+}$ ions as they arise from the
$C^{2+} 1s^2 (2s^2 + 2s2p + 2p^2)$ configurations:

```@example scfci
multiplet     = SelfConsistent.performSCF([Configuration("1s^2 2s^2"), Configuration("1s^2 2s 2p"), Configuration("1s^2 2p^2")], 
                              nucModel, grid, AsfSettings());
Basics.tabulate(stdout, "multiplet: energies", multiplet, Array(1:length(multiplet.levels)) )   # hide
Basics.tabulate(stdout, "multiplet: energy of each level relative to lowest level", multiplet, Array(1:length(multiplet.levels)) )  # hide
```


From the comparison of the two ground-state energies, we see that the admixture of the $2p^2$ configuration has lowered the (total) ground state energy by about 1.8 eV, a rather remarkable admixture, as the $\: ^3P_0$ is just 6.6 eV above of the ground level.

Further control about these electronic computations can be obtained by modifying the (so-called) **settings**. In general, all computations of the electronic structure, properties and processes as well as all more advanced computations can be controlled quite in details by various settings that are associated to the different computational requests. The SCF and configuration interaction calculations are controlled by `AsfSettings` that specify all details for the generation of the ASF. We can first have a look at the internal representation of these settings:

```
? AsfSettings
```

```@docs
AsfSettings
```

... as well as how the standard settings are presently defined:

```@example scfci
defaultAsfSettings = AsfSettings()
```

From this list, we easily see that the self-consistent field is by default based on a *(mean) Dirac-Fock-Slater* potential, a choice which we could overwrite by `meanCH` or any pre-defined potential. At present, however, no full treatment of the exchange interaction has yet been implemented in this first release of the program. The standard settings also show that the SCF is usually based on just the lowest level (cf. `levelScf`) as well as on the accuracy `1.0e-6` to terminate the SCF computations. Moreover, the individual orbitals are improved due to the standard subshell order (cf. `shellSequenceScf`).

For the CI parameters, the treatment of the Breit and QED interaction is of particular interest. At present, the defaults does not included neither Breit interactions nor QED. Such QED estimates can either be neglected (`NoneQed()`) or estimated by using an effective Hamiltonian approach due to Shabaev and coworkers  (`QedPetersburg()`) or effective potential approach (`QedSydney()`; Flambaum et al.) However, further tests need to be done to better understand the reliability of these QED estimates to the level structure and state represetation of the ASF.

As seen from the settings above, moreover, there are special features in order to *select* individual levels for the CI computations, either in terms of their (relative) level No within the given multiplet or in terms of their *level symmetry*, i.e. their total angular momentum and parity, respectively. The  `levelSelectionCI::LevelSelection` here tells whether (and which) selections were made; apparently, no selection of level numbers of symmetries is made by default though this can be overwritten. The selection of individual symmetries, in particular, may considerably reduced the computational effort as the Hamiltonian matrix need then to be calculated only for the selected symmetries.

In principle, these standard settings can be easily *re-defined* within the code by simply modifying the constructor `AsfSetings()` with no additional arguments. Alternatively, we can easily *overwrite* those parameters in some given (instance of) `AsfSetting` which we just wish to modify. This is achieved by

```@example scfci
asfSettings = AsfSettings(defaultAsfSettings; generateScf=true, jjLS=LSjjSettings(true), 
              levelSelectionCI=LevelSelection(true, symmetries=[LevelSymmetry(0,"+"), LevelSymmetry(1,"-")]) )
```

```@example scfci
multiplet     = SelfConsistent.performSCF([Configuration("1s^2 2s^2"), Configuration("1s^2 2s 2p"), 
                               Configuration("1s^2 2p^2"), Configuration("1s^2 3s^2"), 
                               Configuration("1s^2 3p^2")],  nucModel, grid, asfSettings);
Basics.tabulate(stdout, "multiplet: energies", multiplet, Array(1:length(multiplet.levels)) )   # hide
Basics.tabulate(stdout, "multiplet: energy of each level relative to lowest level", multiplet, Array(1:length(multiplet.levels)) )  # hide
```

We finish this (simple) tutorial by enlarging the configuration basis for the low-lying levels but by restricting the CI computations to the level symmetries $J^P = 0^+$ and $1^-$. This is achieved by specifying the settings to:
