## Pluto notebooks
!!! info "Info"
    - The demo files are designed with Pluto notebook. A detailed guideline of Pluto Installation is available at 
      (https://plutojl.org/#install).
    - Users can also find the files in the **demo** folder of the JAC package.


The following Pluto.jl notebooks introduce the reader to JAC and demonstrate several features of this toolbox. ---
They can be explored statically at GitHub or can be run locally after the software repository has been cloned and installed.
Simply call Pluto.run() at the REPL ... and follow your Browser.
