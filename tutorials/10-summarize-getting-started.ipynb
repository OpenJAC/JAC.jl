    "Here, we explain the syntax and meaning of some simple features of Julia as they occur frequently in working with JAC. For new users, this will (hopefully) help to lower the initial 'threshold' for looking into and using Julia & JAC. However, no attempt is made to provide any thorough guide into Julia which, indeed, is a very rich and powerful approach with many features far beyond of what is used in JAC (so far).  "
