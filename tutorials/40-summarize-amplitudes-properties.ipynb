    "### **Atomic form factors for chlorine-like iron ions**\n",
    "In atomic physics, the **form factors** are generally taken as fast approximation to the (scattering) amplitude in forward direction at $\\vartheta \\approx 0$, if an incident quantum wave is scattered by an isolated atom with spherical-symmetric charge distribution. The form factor definition therefore genenerally depends on the particular type of incident radiation, such a photons, electrons or neutrons. In JAC, *as usual*, we restrict ourselves to the atomic **form factor for the elastic (x-ray) scattering of photons**, and they are calculated and tabulated by default for all selected levels of a given multiplet and for a list of pre-specified $q$-values (a.u.). Here, we compute these form factors as (one) selected atomic property for all levels of the [Ne] $3s^2 3p^5$ ground configuration of chlorine-like Fe and Kr ions."

    "The fluorescence yield $\\omega_r$ characterizes the probability of an inner-shell (core) hole to be filled under photon emission, in contrast and competition with other nonradiative processes. It fulfills together with the Auger yield $\\omega_a$ the simple relations: $\\omega_r + \\omega_a = 1$ but generally requires to consider all possible (radiative and non-radiative) decay channels. --- In Jac, the computation of all fluorescence and Auger yields is always traced back to single-step **cascade computation**. Here, we explain how one can readily compute the fluorescence and Auger yields for a few neon-like ions, and how the *fluorescence* increases with the nuclear charge."
