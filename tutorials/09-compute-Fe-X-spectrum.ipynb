In the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) range of spectra, for instance, many of the spectroscopically observed lines belong to the iron-group elements owing to their high abundance in different objects. Until the present, however, several of these lines remained unclassified because reliable theoretical predictions are often not available that consistently include relativistic and correlation effects. \n",

First, all the initial-state levels are calculated *self-consistently* due to the default values for such SCF and configuration-interaction computations, and similarly for all final-state levels. These computations include the definition of the CSF basis, the generation of *start* orbitals as well as the computation of the angular coefficients, the SCF interation and up to the set-up and diagonalization of the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix. Obviously, this gives rise to a full representation of all atomic levels of interest.\n",
