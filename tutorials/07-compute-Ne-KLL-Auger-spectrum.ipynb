    "In this tutorial, we wish to calculate the K-LL spectrum of atomic neon after $1s$ inner-shell ionization as it may occurs, for instance, following photon, electron or neutron impact. An autoionization of an atom or ion generally occurs if the initially-excited level is **energetically embedded into the continuum of the next higher charge state**, and then often also dominates the decay of the atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the neon K-shell ($1s$) electron has a binding energy larger than 800 eV, this condition is fulfilled and may, in priciple, even lead to a 4-5 times multiple ionization, although the initial excitation energy does not tell much of how many electrons will be emitted eventually. This depends of course on the particular decay path\n",

    "An Auger electron emission often leads to characteristic and energetically isolated lines as the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons are given simply by the difference of the (total) initial- and final-level energies. We therefore need to specify only the initial- and final-state multiplets as well as the process identifier `AugerX` in order to calculate the K-LL spectrum with just the standard settings, but by defining a grid that is appropriate to describe *outgoing* electrons:"
