    "which shows the internal definition and the constructors to define such a grid. In practice, there are three (logical) levels that are considered and realized for each grid: \n",
    "(i) The **phenomenological grid** definition that is based on our physics understanding and intuition of which grid is appropriate to decribe a particular atomic property or process. Two currently implemented grid refers to an *exponential* grid (with exponentially increasing stepsize) as appropriate for many bound-state computations and a *linear-logarithmic* grid that start exponentially but becomes linear in its stepsize for large values of $r$. Such a *linear-logarithmic* grid is typically needed to describe electron ionization and capture processes as the incoming or outgoing electron waves are *sinusoidal* and should be represented with a proper number of grid points, say 20-30, per period of the electron wave. In JAC, the *phenomenologically* part of the grid is chosen (analogue as in GRASP) by the parameters `rnt`, `h`, `hp` and `NoPoints` in the definition above. \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) The *phenomenological* definition of the grid is internally translated into a **sequence of knots** upon which the B-spline primitives are defined. Here, each `nth` mesh point from the phenomenological is chosen to keep the number of B-splines and the corresponding size of matrices (that need to be diagonalized) moderate. These knots are used to define the B-splines and to determine the eigenvectors of all orbitals (within some given potential) but they are not applied in order evaluate matrix elements or radial integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) The *phenomenological* grid and the definition of the B-splines (knots) are eventually combined into a **physical grid** upon which all radial functions are represented. This physical grid resembles the phenomenological grid but with modified grid points in between the *knots* of the B-spline grid\n",
    "(t-grid). Here the radial points and corresponding weights are chosen due to a Gauss-Legendre distribution and goal to determine all radial integrals *exact* up to a given *Gauss-Legendre order*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **physical grid** is thus defined by the three arrays `r` (the mesh points along $r$), `rp` (the derivatives d `r`/ dr), `rpor` (the values rp / r) as well as `w` (the corresponding weights). All these arrays are of length `nr` $\\approx$ `NoPoints` but not necessarely equal as the grid points `nr` are coupled to the underlying integration, respectively, interpolation scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, this physical grid could chosen also on other *interpolation/integration* formulas, such as Gauss-Laguerre or others, that have been utilized in atomic physics. All what is needed would be to adapt the intermediate grid point and weights accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clear distinction between the **phenomenological grid** and the **physical grid** help avoid that every new (radial) operator as well as particular boundary condition of the radial orbital functions need to be treated independently within the B-spline basis. Instead, a proper *interpolation/integration* formula should guarantee that all results are integrated sufficiently accurate, and this is first of all tested by enlarging the number of grid point `NoPoint` --> `nr`"
