This is related to the **phase issue**, which refers to the fact that it is not easy to always recognize how the overall phase can be re-written internally so that a particular sum rule applies. Here, we note that the application of any sum rule *always requests* that all other parts of the given Racah expression, including its overall phase, must be independent of those parts which are to be removed. Further (formal) improvement on this **phase issue** might be possible but, sometimes, these equivalences need to be recognized and corrected *manually*."
