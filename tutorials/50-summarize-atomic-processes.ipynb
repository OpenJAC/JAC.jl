    "### **Compute the spectrum of Fe X**\n",
    "We here consider the level structure of Fe$^{9+}$ ions which, in spectroscopic notation, give rise to the spectrum Fe X. Several medium-to-large scale computations have been carried out to calculate the excitation energies and transition probabilities of (and among) the levels from the [Ne] $3s^2 3p^5$ -> $3s^2 3p^4 3d + 3s 3p^6$ configuration. These three configurations comprise in total 31 fine-structure levels with total angular momenta $J = 1/2, ..., 9/2$ (cf. Dong et al., 1999). Although the $3s^2 3p^4 3d + 3s 3p^6$ levels mainly decay by electric-dipole (E1) transitions, also M1, E2 and M2 multipole transitions have been considered in the literature. Below, we show how this *complete* Fe X spectrum can be calculated approximately by just a single call within the JAC toolbox."

    "Here, we show how one can calculate the cross sections and the $\\beta_2$ angular parameters for the photoionzation of atomic argon by linearly-polarized synchrotron radiation. Since the ionization process depends on the energy and polarization of the incident radiatian, the **standard settings** (although available by default) are of little help, and at least the photon energies should normally be specified in advance."

    "In this tutorial, we calculate the K-LL spectrum of atomic neon after $1s$ inner-shell ionization as it may occurs, for instance, following photon, electron or neutron impact. An autoionization of an atom or ion generally occurs if the initially-excited level is **energetically embedded into the continuum of the next higher charge state**, and then often also dominates the decay of the atom."

    "A plasma environment generally affects both, the level structure of atoms and ions as well their rates and cross sections. In this tutorial, we wish to compute the K-LL rates for neon-like iron in a Debye-Hückel potential following the work by Deprince *et al* (2019). --- A Debye-Hückel potential may affect the Auger rates of an atom or ion in three different ways: (i) the level structure due to the screened electron-nucleus and electron-electron interaction; (ii) the shape of the potential, seen by the emitted electrons, due to the plasma screening of the ionic core; as well as (iii) the screening of the electron-electron interaction within the Auger matrix. In the present implementation, only the (screened) Coulomb interaction can be taken into account for the computation of the plasma-modified Auger rates, i.e. **no** Breit interactions nor QED estimates are supported by the JAC program for such plasma computations."
