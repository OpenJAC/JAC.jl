    "Julia is known as a programming language that has been designed for combining (high) performance and productivity. The initial design of Julia was started about 2009, and a first beta version was launched around 2012 (well before I got aware of it). Since then, the **Julia community** has grown very rapidly. While Julia has been developed as a general-purpose language for many different applications, its central features are well suited for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science, and as required especially for modelling quantum many-particle systems. Indeed, Julia comprises a very careful design and a good number of modern technologies that enables the user to gradually learning modern concepts in scientific computing."

    "Julia offers various features that are otherwise just known from (so-called) *productivity languages*, including rapid development cycles; exploratory programming without the need to type declarations and memory management; language extensibility via multiple dispatch as well as various features for meta-programming and parallelization. In particular, Julia provides the user with dynamic typing, automatic garbage collection as well as a type-specializing *just-in-time* compilation of code, and which enables one to port code to other platforms with only moderate adaptions. With the rapid growth of the Julia user community, there has been developed a large number of tutorials https://julialang.org/learning/ which help the user to get started."

    "The modern features of Julia are quite *in contrast* to the codes that are currently applied in **computational atomic physics** or, more generally, in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics. Mainly for historical reason (and the existence of more or less powerful codes), most atomic computations make still use of Fortran or C. Since atomic structure (and collision) theory has been developed parallel with Fortran, a large (or even huge) amount of Fortran code exists and is applied by the community, a situation with sometimes undesired consequences: Newcomers to computional atomic or AMO either have to *learn* the basics about Fortran programming or, *vice versa*, begin to belief that both, (the use of) Fortran and atomic physics are old-fashioned. From a physics viewpoint, however, the opposite is true: Until the present, **atomic pyhsics has proven to be a great playground** for developing new ideas, concepts or theoretical methods in quantum many-particle physics. With the design of the **Jena Atomic Calculator (JAC)**, I wish to show that atomic computations can be made simple and applied toward modern and emerging fields of physics. "

Instead, we just wish to remind and highlight some simple (syntax) features that help to go easier around with JAC, and especially for occasional users from experiment or teaching. This reminder aims to lower the initial *threshold* for users that have been trained on other languages in the past. Here, we shall *pick up* some issues whose physics background is explained only later in other tutorial. Obviously, however, Julia is a very rich and powerful language with many features that go well beyond of what is (and will ever) needed for JAC."

These `Settings` are context dependent and are different for each atomic property or process that can be computed by the JAC toolbox. They are defined in the various modules and need to be specified accordingly. For instance, to control the computation of transition probabilities for the (fine-structure) levels between given initial- and final-state configuration, one has to overwrite the (defaults) settings:"

    "**Code failures:$\\quad$** Beside of its large flexibility and user-friendliness, JAC might terminate from time to time for *non-obvious* reasons. Since JAC is first of all a *physics code*, no attempt has been made that all possible errors are fully captured and recovered by the program. Wrong input parameters or an inappropriate use of contructors will often lead to errors that cannot be resolved by the program. While some of this input can be readily recognized as wrong, and then lead to a proper error message, other wrong data may appear dynamically and cannot be captured with a reasonable overhead of the code.  In JAC, therefore, several conditional `if ... elseif ... else ... end` blocks include an additional clause `error(\"stop a\")` or similar; these are clauses, which due to a first design of a function should never be entered, but this appears not to be true in all cases. The use of these (fully) *non-instructive* error message have still a great advantage due to Julia: If not switched-off explicitly, Julia always reports for all program failures the hierarchy of call's, that are made before the error occurs, and lists these calls together with the file and line number of source code. For this reason, an `error(\"stop a\")` readily shows the position where something unexpected occurs. A short inspection of the corresponding (line of the) source code often help to understand of what went wrong internally."
