# JAC capabilities register

**What this file is for.** JAC has grown past the point where any one person -- maintainer, collaborator, or an AI tool reading the repository -- can hold its full feature set in their head. This file exists to answer two questions quickly, for a human or for an AI assistant acting on a human's behalf:

1. **Is JAC already able to do what I need, even approximately?**
2. **Which one or two example branches should I open first to try it and adapt it?**

**What this file is NOT.** It is not the manual, and completeness of DETAIL is explicitly not the goal -- simple use and fast orientation are. The full technical detail lives in each module's own docstrings and in `docs/`; this file only tells you whether to look there at all, and where to start. It IS complete in COVERAGE, though: every branch listed by `examples/examples.jl` gets its own row here, mechanically, so nothing in that index goes missing from this one.

**How to trust what it says.** Every row's date comes from that branch's own `# Last successful: DD-Mon-YYYY` comment line in `examples/*.jl` -- the one marker in this codebase that a human, not a tool, has ever written after physically judging the numbers (see `CLAUDE.md`, Rule 7). A row marked **unknown/undated** means exactly that: the module exists and the branch runs, but nobody has yet judged the physics, or an earlier judgement was withdrawn. An omitted `Module:` line means the same kind of honesty -- this register's generator could not confidently name one, rather than guessing.

**Restrictions column.** A one-line hint, not a specification. It exists to stop a false start, not to replace reading the branch. A blank entry means no restriction is currently flagged -- not that none exists.

**One file, several branches.** Several example files carry more than one `if true`/`if false` branch, each dated independently. The date shown below is the MOST RECENT judged date found ANYWHERE in that file, which may belong to a different branch than the one you actually want -- always check the specific branch's own `Last successful` comment before trusting a copied date. `example-Ar.jl` is a real case of this: one branch there carries a genuine 13-Sep-2026 date while a different, still-undated branch in the SAME file is the one most readers would reach for first.

**Searching this file.** Use your editor's find, a plain `grep -i -B1 -A5 "<term>" CAPABILITIES.md`, or the small helper that prints a matched entry with its full context: `julia tools/searchCapabilities.jl "<term>"`. All three are plain substring search -- "DR" will also match "quaDRupole"; that is a known, accepted limit of keeping the tool genuinely simple, not a defect.
